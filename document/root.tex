\title{Pratt's Primality Certificates \\ (Isabelle Formalisation)}
\author{By Simon Wimmer and Lars Noschinski}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In 1975 Vaughan Pratt introduced a proof system for certifying primes in his work
  "Every Prime has a Succinct CertiÔ¨Åcate"\cite{pratt1975certificate}.
  By showing a logarithmic upper bound on the length of the certicates in size of the prime number,
  he concluded that PRIMES $\in$ NP holds.
  This work formalizes Pratt's proof system and show that Pratt's primality certificates are sound
  and complete and that the size of a primality certificate for some prime p is logarithmic in p.
  These proofs are based on Lehmer's theorem, also known as Little Fermat's Theorem Converse,
  which is proved in the first part of this work.
  As a side product of this proof, this work shows and formalizes some algebraic properties,
  including:
  \begin {itemize}
  \item The notion of the order of an element
  \item The existence of a generator for the multiplicative group of all finite fields
  \end {itemize}
\end{abstract}
