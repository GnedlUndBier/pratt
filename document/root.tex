\title{Pratt's Primality Certificates \\ (Isabelle Formalisation)}
\author{By Simon Wimmer and Lars Noschinski}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In 1975 Vaughan Pratt introduced a proof system for certifying primes in his work
  "Every Prime has a Succinct CertiÔ¨Åcate"\cite{pratt1975certificate}.
  He showed that a number $p$ is prime iff a primality certificate for $p$ exists.
  By showing a logarithmic upper bound on the length of the certicates in size of the prime number,
  he concluded that the decision problem for prime numbers is in NP, in short PRIMES $\in$ NP.
  This work formalizes Pratt's proof system and shows the results mentioned before.  
  These proofs are based on Lehmer's theorem, a converse of Fermat's little theorem,
  which is proved in the first part of this work.
  As a side product of this proof, this work formalizes some algebraic properties, including:
  \begin {itemize}
  \item Some properties of the Euler phi function
  \item The notion of the order of an element
  \item The cyclicity of the multiplicative group of any finite field
  \end {itemize}
\end{abstract}
